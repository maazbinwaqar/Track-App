                Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using
                your third-party social media account details (like your
                Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we

                vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will
                often include your name, email address, friends list, and

                personal information by your third-party social media provider.
                We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand
                how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and

                have an account with us.<br /><br />When we have no ongoing
                legitimate business need to process your personal information,
                we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this
                is not possible (for example, because your personal information

                no electronic transmission over the Internet or information
                storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we
                cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or
                other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
                security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
                information. Although we will do our best to protect your
                personal information, transmission of personal information to
                and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only
                access the Services within a secure environment.

                the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or
